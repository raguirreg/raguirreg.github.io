My name is Raúl Aguirre-Gamboa, at the moment I'm wrapping up my PhD thesis while working as a research associate at the [Department of Genetics](https://www.rug.nl/research/genetics/?lang=en) at the [University Medical Center of Groningen](https://www.umcg.nl/NL/Zorg/paginas/Default.aspx). My main research interest is to understand the inter-individual variation of the human immune response in health and disease. I investigate this by applying computational and statistical methods deeply phenotypes cohorts where millions of data points have been measured. I enjoy working on dynamic and collaborative projects were researchers from diverse backgrounds work together to try to comprehend complex biological phenomena.
