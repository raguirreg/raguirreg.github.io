## Welcome to my personal webpage

My name is Raúl Aguirre-Gamboa, I’m currently a PhD candidate working at an intersection of computational biology, genomics and immunology at the Department of Genetics in the University Medical Center of Groningen. My main research interest is to understand the inter-individual variation of the human immune response in health and disease. I investigate this by applying computational and statistical methods deeply phenotypes cohorts where millions of data points have been measured. I enjoy working on dynamic and collaborative projects were researchers from diverse backgrounds work together to try to comprehend complex biological phenomena.
